Overview
=============================
**Financial reinforcement learning (FinRL)**, as an interdisciplinary field of finance and reinforcement learning, has been recognized as a promising approach to financial tasks. Over the past decade, **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** has achieved remarkable success in solving complex problems across a variety of domains, including: robotics, gaming, and large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. The success of DRL has also led to its application in finance, where it has demonstrated great potential for enhancing the performance of financial tasks, such as: portfolio management, option pricing, and algorithmic trading.

The **FinRL contest** is a competition that explores and evaluates the capability of machine learning methods in finance. However, developing machine learning algorithms for financial data presents unique challenges:


- **Dynamic Transitions and Data Noise**:  
  Financial datasets are constantly evolving, making it difficult to capture the underlying dynamics. Moreover, financial data is often susceptible to noise and anomalies.

- **Partial Observability**:  
  No traders can access complete market-influencing information due to the gigantic, complex, and unpredictable nature of financial systems, where unforeseen events like natural disasters, policy changes, and consumer behavior shifts can have hard-to-anticipate effects.

- **Other Complex Behaviors**:  
  Many other factors can cause complicated and unpredictable behaviors, such as the marketâ€™s decentralized nature and the large number of financial instruments available.


The **FinRL Contest 2023** presents two tasks: **data-centric stock trading** and **real-time order execution**, aiming to foster innovations toward addressing the above challenges.

We welcome students, researchers, and engineers who are passionate about finance and machine learning.  
We encourage the development of:

- Tailored data processing strategies  
- Novel features  
- Innovative algorithms  

These approaches should adapt to changing market conditions and aim to generate superior returns for investors.
