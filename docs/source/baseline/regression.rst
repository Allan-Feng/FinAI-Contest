ML Methods
==================

In addition to the market indices and classic methods, we also use several machine learning methods as baselines in the FinAI contests. These methods can serve as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of trading models.

Linear Regression Model
----------------------------
The linear regression model is a simple yet effective method for predicting stock prices based on historical data. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features (e.g., past stock prices, technical indicators) and the target variable (future stock price). The model can be trained using historical data to learn the coefficients that minimize the prediction error.
