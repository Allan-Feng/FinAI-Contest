As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance rapidly, more and more AI agents are being developed and applied to various financial tasks, such as trading agents, search agents, and regulatory reporting agents. The FinAI Contest 2025 aims to encourage the development of advanced financial agents and benchmark their performance across different financial tasks.

The FinRL Contest 2025 explores and evaluates the capability of machine learning methods in finance, with the following features:
1. **FinRL-DeepSeek**. Generating alpha signals is crucial for making informed trading decisions. As individual investors without resources, what if we can ask Warren Buffett for value-investing advice, consult a risk manager to identify red flags in SEC filings, or engage a sentiment analyst to interpret the tone of market news â€” all timely and on demand. AI agents make this possible. These LLM-powered agents, such as a Warren Buffett agent, a sentiment analysis agent, and a risk management agent, form a professional investment team to extract actionable signals from financial documents. In this contest, we encourage participants to explore LLM-generated signals and integrate them into FinRL for crypto trading.
2. **FinAI Agents**. AI agents have seen rapid development and have been applied to various financial tasks recently. But can they truly understand the language of finance? Imagine an AI agent that can help us prepare for CFA exams, explain the SEC filings, or guide us through financial contracts. Despite this promise, there are still `questions about whether AI models truly understand the professional language of finance <https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/19/gpt-and-other-ai-models-cant-analyze-an-sec-filing-researchers-find.html>`_. This task encourages participants to take on that challenge: fine-tune LLMs and develop financial agents for professional financial language, including the CFA exam, XBRL, and CDM.


Tasks
---------------

The **FinAI Contest 2025** has the following tasks:

1. **FinRL-DeepSeek for Crypto Trading**: Develop crypto trading agents by integrating LLM-generated signals in FinRL, using financial news and market data.

2. **FinAgent using Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune LLMs and develop financial agents to interpret professional language of finance.
        - **CFA exam**: The CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) exam is a globally recognized exam for financial analysts. It covers a wide range of financial topics, such as investment, economics, and quantitative methods.
