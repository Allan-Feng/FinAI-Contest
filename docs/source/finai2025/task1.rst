Task 1 FinRL-DeepSeek for Crypto Trading
=====================================================

Task Overview
----------------


Why This Matters
----------------
Generating alpha signals is crucial for making informed trading decisions. As individual investors without resources, what if we can ask Warren Buffett for value-investing advice, consult a risk manager to identify red flags in SEC filings, or engage a sentiment analyst to interpret the tone of market news â€” all timely and on demand. AI agents make this possible. These LLM-powered agents, such as a Warren Buffett agent, a sentiment analysis agent, and a risk management agent, form a professional investment team to extract actionable signals from financial documents. In this contest, we encourage participants to explore LLM-generated signals and integrate them into FinRL for crypto trading.
