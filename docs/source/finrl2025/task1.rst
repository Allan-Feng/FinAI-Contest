Task 1 FinRL-DeepSeek for Stock Trading
=========================================

This task is about developing automated stock trading agents trained on stock prices and financial news data by combining reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs). Participants can build upon the `FinRL-DeepSeek project <https://github.com/benstaf/FinRL_DeepSeek>`_ (e.g., with new prompts, new ways to inject LLM-processed news signals into the RL agent, new RL algorithms like GRPO) or explore more computationally intensive directions, such as adapting variants of the DeepSeek R1 training method to this stock trading task.

Datasets
--------

The `Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID) <https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zihan1004/FNSPID>`_ comprises stock prices and 15 million time-aligned financial news records for Nasdaq companies, covering the period from 1999 to 2023. The processed training dataset based on the FNSPID will be provided. 

Participants are also encouraged to utilize publicly available data, such as Twitter, or develop scraping/API AI agents for this purpose. Some teams can choose to focus their submission on improving the dataset, while others may focus on enhancing trading agents.
