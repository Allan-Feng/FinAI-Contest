High-quality market environments are crucial to develop powerful trading agents. Financial data, featuring non-stationary and low signal-to-noise ratio, is processed into standard gym-style  market environments. A financial task is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by defining the state, action, and reward. In this section, we summarize the parallel market environments used in FinAI and FinRL Contests, including the MDP, environment operations, market constraints, and massively parallel simulations on GPUs.
