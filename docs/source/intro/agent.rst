Agent
=============================

In FinRL, the agent is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model that learns to take trading actions based on the current state of the market. The agent interacts with the environment, which represents the financial market, and takes trading actions to maximize its cumulative reward over time. In this section, we summarize supported RL libraries and different algorithms used in the FinAI contests.
